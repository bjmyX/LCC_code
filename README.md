# LCC_code
#Readme:
#This code demonstrates the numerical simualtion of the core of legged consensus control, which is converted from the robot computer.
#You can directly run this code and refer to the code comments to gain a deeper understanding of the corresponding equations in the paper.

# Note that this code content is not comprehensive and only includes the core algorithm in LCC: multi-feet consensus combined with sliding mode control.
# It does not include variable topography, foot trajectory planning and linear mapping, which will be fully open source in the future.

# You can change the parameter in line 186 to "self.display = 'velocity'" to view the velocity state of foot-end.
